                    <h2> Overview </h2>
                    <p> MyMovies-client is a web application built using ReactJS, which gives registered users access to a collection
                        of movies. Users can view details about movie genres and directors, save their favorite movies and update
                        their profile information.
                    </p>
                    <h3> Purpose and Context </h3>
                    <p>
                        I worked on MyMovies-client as part of the CareerFoundy Full-Stack Immersion Course. The app’s name
                        contains “-client” because it was build as the client-side for another application called myMovies, which is
                        the server-side code storing the movies collection (REST API and database).
                        This project shows my ability to work with the React library, React Redux and Bootstrap for styling and
                        responsiveness.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Objective</h3>
                    <p>
                        The aim was to add to my portfolio a project build with the React framework, which is widely popular and
                        requested by employers. Full-stack development comprises skills in both the server-side and client-side of
                        web applications. Building both sides from scratch and providing a great user experience are the goals of the
                        overall MyMovies-client project.

                    <h1>Building MyMovies</h1>
                    <h2> React Components & the Virtual DOM </h2>
                    <p>
                        As first step of the project, I got familiar with React’s Components, syntactical elements that encapsulates
                        the logic and styling for a piece of a UI. Components split a UI down into its individual parts, making it easier
                        to build, maintain and scale. For example, the main view of MyMovies contains numerous Movie
                        Card components, each of which displays a movie with an image, title, and button to show more
                        information. Rather than writing a new card for each movie, I instead created a reusable Movie
                        Card component. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The same logic applies to all the other parts of the web app whose UI can be reused. A movie’s description is
                        shown in the Movie View Component, directors’ information is stored in the Director View Component etc. I
                        learnt to always follow the industry standard for development using React, which is to set up and organize
                        the project folder structure by giving each Component its own folder, and storing all Components in the
                        same folder. As components kept adding up with time, the folder became quite lengthy. To avoid confusion I
                        made sure to give Components a clear name and function.

                    <h2> Fetching movies with Axios </h2>
                    <p>After creating its initial Components, MyMovies-client had to connect to the back-end movies collection in
                        the MyMovies database. The JavaScript package Axios made this possible, by hooking up the MyMovies API.
                        The challenge was to use the correct return statements and props matching the backend code. The errors I
                        encountered were mostly typos and code whose function I did not recall. For example, in the Movie Card
                        Components I wrote props with capital letters “Director.Name”, while the code in the Database was in
                        lowercase “director.name” (the image below shows an example of the correct Movie Card View props). This
                        taught me the importance of leaving descriptive comments and notes tracking the logic behind the code. It is
                        part of developers’ job to make it as easy as possible for themselves and others to pick up a project that’s
                        already been written.
